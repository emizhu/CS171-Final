        Placeholding Notes: This preliminary version of the visualization shows how much time each
        group on average spends on the activity over a one year period. The visualization
        has the option of showing the aggregate of time spent on two different visualizations
        (e.g. housework and childcare) for two different groups (e.g. full-time employed married
        men vs. women).
        <br><br>
        Though not implemented yet, we plan to add an axis label that names
        each group, another label indicating that one row contains 24 blocks to represent "one day",
        some text or tooltip after the time lapse to explicitly state the difference in number of hours
        (e.g. 121 in the example), and a calendar time lapse (e.g. scrolling through the months of the year)
        so that it's clear to the user that each time lapse corresponds to one year of time.
