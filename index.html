                 <br> How are Americans using their time? <br><br>Well, it depends.<br><br>
                It depends on who you are - your age, for example, or maybe your employment status.
                Depending on who you are, you might spend your time on different activities than others.
                Let's visualize some of these differences and explore the nuances of time in America.

                <h2>Losing Time: The Implications of <br> Different Time Usage Among Groups</h2>
                 On a day to day basis, we lose countless minutes on day-to-day tasks, from running errands to transportation<br>
                to answering emails. Over longer periods, these minutes add up to take on days, then weeks, then months of our time!<br>
                Different individuals spend their time very differently, but particular demographic groups tend to spend their<br>
                time differently. Scroll to explore what these differences look like over the span
                of a year and why these differences arise.<br>

                        <!--[BACKGROUND INFO & DESCRIPTION OF VISUALIZATION] -->
                        <span class="prompt"><em> <p>Play the animation to see how time use builds up over a year.
                            Hover over the saturated squares to see how much time is spent in a year on this activity.

                        <p>While more women have joined the workforce and the gender pay gap has narrowed,
                            studies show that the “housework gap” has largely stopped narrowing. <sup>5</sup>
                            There may be additional explanatory factors, such as employment or family status,
                            that can explain gender differences in housework. We hold these constant by limiting
                            our sample to only full-time currently employed individuals with a spouse
                            and children present in their household. With these constraints, women in this group spend
                            an average of 89 minutes a day on childcare and 112 minutes a day on housework, compared to 60 minutes
                            and 51 minutes respectively for men.

                        <p>Different geographic locations have vastly different experiences with transportation.
                            access to public transportation is often concentrated in urban areas. At the
                            same time, cities are facing rising traffic congestion across the United States with
                            little possibility of policy solutions.<sup>6</sup> Drivers in Los Angeles, for example,
                            were found to spend an extra 80 hours a year in traffic. <sup>7</sup> For those who commute
                            for work, who spends more time on transportation and how much more time is lost in
                            the traffic?

                        <p>Oftentimes, we think of leisure in contrast to work; we work so that we can play
                            and people with different relationships to work thus
                            may have different opportunities for leisure. We explore leisure time in relation to employment
                            for those who are currently employed compared to those who are "Off the Labor Force"
                            The Census category of "Off the Labor Force" applies to anyone who is neither
                            working nor actively seeking work, including retirees, caregivers, and other groups.
                            Rather than viewing retirement as a "finish line," 88% of retirees consider it an opportunity for
                            new beginnings, with more time to pursue non-work interests. <sup>7</sup> Others, however,
                            may be off the labor force but still have responsibilities at home or challenges without
                            the economic security of work that make it difficult to pursue against pursuing leisure.

                        For example, an orange circle with a percentile of 90 for sleep means that on average,
                        respondents in the orange group spent more time on sleep than 90% of all respondents.

                        The American Time Use Survey is sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
                        and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau collects and processes the data.
                        Households that have completed their final (8th) month of the Current Population Survey are eligible
                        for the ATUS. From this eligible group, households are selected that represent a range of demographic
                        characteristics. Then, one person age 15 or over is randomly chosen from the household to answer questions
                        about his or her time use. This person is interviewed for the ATUS 2-5 months after the household's final
                        CPS interview.<br><br>

                    <div class="col-md-10">
                        ATUS data are collected via telephone interviews. Census Bureau interviewers use Computer Assisted Telephone
                        Interviewing, a system that automatically advances interviewers to the next question based on a respondent's
                        answers to previous questions. Respondents receive an advance letter and pamphlet explaining the purpose of
                        the ATUS and notifying them of the day they will be called. The main part of the ATUS interview is the 24-hour
                        time diary. This part of the interview is used to collect a detailed account of the respondent's activities,
                        starting at 4 a.m. the previous day and ending at 4 a.m. on the interview day. For each activity reported,
                        the interviewer asks how long the activity lasted. For most activities, the interviewer also asks who was in
                        the room or accompanied the respondent during the activity and where the activity took place.<br><br>

                        Each entry in the dataset corresponds to one individual, and captures their demographic
                        data and their exact time breakdown over a 24-hour period.<br><br>
